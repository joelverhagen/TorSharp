# TorSharp

Use Tor for your C# HTTP clients. Tor + Privoxy = :heart:

All you need is client code that can use a simple HTTP proxy.

## Install

```
Install-Package Knapcode.TorSharp
```

## Example

```csharp
// configure
var settings = new TorSharpSettings
{
   ZippedToolsDirectory = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), "TorZipped"),
   ExtractedToolsDirectory = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), "TorExtracted"),
   PrivoxySettings = { Port = 1337 },
   TorSettings =
   {
      SocksPort = 1338,
      ControlPort = 1339,
      ControlPassword = "foobar",
   },
};

// download tools
await new TorSharpToolFetcher(settings, new HttpClient()).FetchAsync();

// execute
var proxy = new TorSharpProxy(settings);
var handler = new HttpClientHandler
{
    Proxy = new WebProxy(new Uri("http://localhost:" + settings.PrivoxySettings.Port))
};
var httpClient = new HttpClient(handler);
await proxy.ConfigureAndStartAsync();
Console.WriteLine(await httpClient.GetStringAsync("http://api.ipify.org"));
await proxy.GetNewIdentityAsync();
Console.WriteLine(await httpClient.GetStringAsync("http://api.ipify.org"));
proxy.Stop();
```

## FAQ

### The tool fetcher is throwing an exception. What do I do?

This most likely is happening because the URLs where we fetch Tor or Privoxy from are down or have changed. I would
recommend:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/joelverhagen/TorSharp/issues/new) so I can look into it.

1. Work around the issue by setting up the tools manually and not using `TorSharpToolFetcher`.
   [See below](#how-do-i-set-up-the-tools-manually).

1. Investigate the issue yourself. The
   [TorSharp.Sandbox](https://github.com/joelverhagen/TorSharp/blob/release/samples/TorSharp.Sandbox/Program.cs) project is
   helpful for this. Pull requests accepted üèÜ.

### How do I set up the tools manually?

If you don't want to use the `TorSharpToolFetcher` to download the latest version of the tools for you or if you want
to use a specific version of Tor and Privoxy, follow these steps.

1. Make a directory that will hold the zipped Tor and Privoxy binaries.
1. Put a Tor Win32 ZIP in that folder with the file name like: `tor-win32-{version}.zip`
   - `{version}` must be parsable as a `System.Version` meaning it is `major.minor[.build[.revision]]`.
   - Example: `tor-win32-0.3.5.8.zip`
   - The ZIP is expected to have `Tor\tor.exe`.
1. Put a Privoxy Win32 ZIP in that folder with a file name like: `privoxy-win32-{version}.zip`
   - Again, `{version}` must be parsable as a `System.Version`.
   - Example: `privoxy-win32-3.0.26.zip`
   - The ZIP is expected to have `privoxy.exe`.
1. Initialize a `TorSharpSettings` instance where `ZippedToolsDirectory` is the directory created above.
1. Pass this settings instance to the `TorSharpProxy` constructor.

### Privoxy fetched by TorSharp fails to start? Try `ExecutablePathOverride`.

On Linux, the Privoxy binaries fetched seem to be built for Debian and Ubuntu distributions. I can confirm that
some other distributions don't work. For example, on CentOS 7 the following error appears:

`
/tmp/TorExtracted/privoxy-linux64-3.0.28/usr/sbin/privoxy: error while loading shared libraries: libpcre.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
`

I'm no Linux expert but my guess is that the version of PCRE on CentOS 7 vs. Ubuntu is different so at runtime the
library can't be found on CentOS. The easiest workaround is to install Privoxy to your system and set the
`TorSharpSettings.PrivoxySetting.ExecutablePathOverride` configuration setting to `"privoxy"` (i.e. use Privoxy
from PATH).

Note that you may encounter warning or error messages in the output due to new configuration being used with an older
executable. I haven't ran into any problems with this myself but it's possible things could get weird.

#### CentOS 7

Install Privoxy. It is available on `epel-release`.

```console
[joel@centos]$ sudo yum install epel-release -y
...
[joel@centos]$ sudo yum install privoxy -y
```

Ensure Privoxy is available in PATH.

```console
[joel@centos]$ which privoxy
/usr/sbin/privoxy
```

Set the Privoxy `ExecutablePathOverride` to `"privoxy"`.

```csharp
var settings = new TorSharpSettings();
settings.PrivoxySettings.ExecutablePathOverride = "privoxy";
```
